## Description

🔍 In this application, I've developed an API for a social networking web platform that enables users to express their thoughts, respond to their friends' posts, and build a list of friends. The technology stack includes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM). In addition to the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you have the option to incorporate a JavaScript date library of your preference or utilize the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
